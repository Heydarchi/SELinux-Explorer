## TODO List

### Analyzer

- [ ] Enable multi-threading
  - Is still need to have multi-threading?
  - Is this needed to switch the programming language?
- [ ] Refactor the code architecture
- [ ] Support additional policy file formats and SELinux variants
- [ ] Implement rule-based analysis to suggest improvements or detect potential issues
- [ ] Utilize file names in information gathering and analysis
- [ ] Make it possible to utilize some SELinux-Explorer functions in the command line
- [ ] Utilizing the existing tools in SELinux-Explorer
- [ ] Provide file name, etc. in diagram to make it easier to fix the problem


### GUI

- [ ] Show the progress of the analysis
- [ ] Display the number of files and folders in the list
- [ ] Add a new window for the reference files
- [ ] Create references from paths and files
- [ ] Search the input file and the generated files
- [ ] Add AND/OR for combining the filter rules
- [ ] Sort result files by date
- [ ] Enhance the GUI with more customization options, such as themes and layout preferences
- [ ] Implement an in-app editor for creating and modifying policy files
- [ ] Add some buttons to save/load paths and files
- [ ] Add other categories such as MACRO_CALL, MACRO_DEF, etc
- [ ] Make it possible to search for all the categories
- [ ] Suggest for the right place to add the new rules
- [ ] Implement a Wizard if it has any advantages

### Integration and Performance

- [ ] Optimize performance by implementing caching and/or parallel processing
- [ ] Develop a plugin system to enable easy integration with other tools or platforms

### Documentation and Contribution

- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation and tutorials for users and contributors
- [ ] Expand the test suite to cover more edge cases and improve overall code coverage

### Miscellaneous

- [ ] Add support for other SELinux variants, such as SELinux for Linux Containers
